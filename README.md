I’m Cassie (she/her) and I’m a senior. I like to draw, write, and am Co-Content Director of the Humans Versus Zombies club. I’m a computer science major, and have taken almost of all the required courses for the major (CS 1-3, Assembly Language & Computer Architecture, Object Oriented Programming, Software Engineering, Discrete & Continuous Algorithms, as well as Discrete Mathematics and Digital Logic if those count. I’ve also taken Web Design, and have continued to practice it as a hobby afterwards with small personal web projects.

I see myself using what we learn from this course in both professional and personal settings. I plan on getting a proper web design/programming job once I graduate, but even if that doesn’t work out, I still want to do it as a hobby and apply the skills from this class.
